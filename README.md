# EasyLite Home Automation System

# Project Description
EasyLite is a proof of concept Internet of Things (IoT) home automation system capable of automatically monitoring the environment, changing the state of electronics based on collected physical data, and providing the user real time updates and system controls via a mobile application.

The main goal of EasyLite was to provide a means of conserving energy, and reducing the overall cost of electricity for a user, while improving the quality of life of the user via automated features. This is primarily done by taking the need for human interaction out of the equation, while also giving the user a means of monitoring and controlling their home system remotely through the use of a mobile application. This is done by creating an IoT system, by interlacing an embedded system, multiple cloud services, and a mobile application.
